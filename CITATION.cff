  The Python package gitma-CANSpiN is based on GitMA 2.0.1
  (https://github.com/forTEXT/gitma) and is adapted for the
  needs of the CANSpiN project. It can be used for export,
  analysis, visualization and the creation of a gold
  standard of annotation data in Catma
  (https://www.catma.de). This package is still a work in
  progress and is currently not being tested for use in
  project scenarios other than the CANSpiN project.
